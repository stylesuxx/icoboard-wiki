# icoBoard Wiki
This Wiki is intended to document findings with the icoBoard from a noob perspective.

## Disclaimer
I was asked to document my findings with the icoBoard from a noob perspective.
The icoBoard is my first FPGA dev board. I have no experiences with FPGA's so far - so do not expect the truth in here.
