## icoBoard Wiki
This Wiki is intended to document my findings on the [icoBoard](http://icoboard.org) from a beginners perspective.
The [icoBoard](http://icoboard.org) is my first [FPGA]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/#fpga) decelopment Board. I will document my progress here and hope that it will help other noobs interested in the topic of FPGA's.

### Prerequisites
This Wiki assumes that you know your way around in Debian based Linux. Also that you have a basic knowledge of electronics. A [glossary]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/) is in place and terms are linked where appropriate - rather than linking to Wikipedia I will try to explain the terms in my own words.

### Contributions
Contributions are very welcome, this is a Markdown Wiki hosted on [github](https://github.com/stylesuxx/icoboard-wiki) so feel free to submit your *pull request* or your [issues](https://github.com/stylesuxx/icoboard-wiki/issues).
