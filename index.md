# icoBoard Wiki
This Wiki is intended to document my findings on the icoBoard from a beginners perspective.
The icoBoard is my first FPGA decelopment Board. I will document my progress here and hope that it will help other noobs interested in the topic of FPGA's.

## Prerequisites
This Wiki assumes that you know your way around in Debian based Linux. Also that you have a basic knowledge of electronics. A [glossary](pages/glossary.md) is in place and terms are linked where appropriate - rather than linking to Wikipedia I will try to explain the terms in my own words.
