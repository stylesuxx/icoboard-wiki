## DIY
This section shows some [PMOD]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/#pmod) boards you can build from components you most probably have in your shop when you are into electronics. If you do not have the parts already, check out the [buy](#buy) section, you may find that some boards are cheaper if you buy them ready assembled than buying the single parts and soldering them yourself.

### 8 LEDs
The **icoBoard** already has 3 LEDs pre populated, but this may not be enough.

**Bom:**

* 8 LEDs with a color of your choosing
* 8 Matching resistors

### 2 RGB LEDs
With a double PMOD port it is possible to drive 2 RGB LEDs (and have two spare pins).

**Bom:**

* 2 RGB LEDs
* 6 Matching resistors. Keep in mind, that each of the 3 individual LED's inside the RGB LED may have a different forward voltage and thus require different values

### 8 Buttons
As with the LEDs, the **icoBoard** has already two buttons populated, in case you need more, this board is for you.

**Bom:**

* 8 Micro buttons
* 8 pull down resistors
