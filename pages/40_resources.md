## Verilog

### Introduction
* [Operators](https://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo/verilog-operators) - explanation of all different operators available in verilog
* [Synchronous Logic](https://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo/synchronous-logic) - synchronous logic explained in a video with in depth text
* [Overall language overview in German](http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/Verilog) - a good overall verilog language overview in *german*

### Tutorials
* [Verilog Tutorials for iCE40HX8K](https://github.com/peepo/verilog_tutorials_BB) - Adaptation of the [Embedded Micro tutorial](https://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/) for iCE40HX8K
* [CPLD Verilog intro](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/CPLD_Verilog_intro_1:_Light_a_LED) - Dangerous Prototypes on how to light a LED on their CPLD platform, they have multiple basic tutorials
* [Verilog tutorial](http://www.ece.umd.edu/class/enee359a/verilog_tutorial.pdf) - by [asci-world.com](http://asic-world.com); *asic world* has a lot of material regarding different HDL's, but also very basic digital electronics tutorials.
* [fpga4fun.com](http://www.fpga4fun.com/) - This is the tutorial heaven, definitely check that out if you are looking for inspiration what to do

### Misc
* [Quick Reference Sheet](http://www.tcnj.edu/~hernande/Eng312/Verilog(R)_QRC__02.pdf) - The quick reference sheet I use the most

## Electronics

### Basics

* [EEVblog #496 - What Is An FPGA?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUsHwi4M4xE) - EEVblog video about what an FPGA is, very enthusiastic guy.
* [What is an FPGA ](https://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo-fpga-beginners-guide/what-is-an-fpga) - *Embedded Micro* on what an [FPGA]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/#fpga) is
* [Transistors](https://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/beginning-electronics/transistors) - *Embedded Micro* on what a Transistor is, they also have other basic electronics tutorials; definitely worth a read if you are catching up on the basics
* [AND OR NOT - Logic Gates Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvI-AMAtrvE) - *Computerphile* video on logic gates
